# CardanoPress - Stake Pools

The Stake Pools plugin allows stake pool operators or projects to list their stake pools for users to delegate their wallets to.

If you're a single stake pool operator, you can simply use the plugin to display your stake pool details and have a connect button that will allow users to use a Cardano based Web3 wallet and delegate to your pool, directly from your website.

As a mulit stake pool operator owner or a projects that is using a collection of stake pools that you may or may not own, you can list the various stake pools by pool ID, have the statistics and data displayed accordingly and allow users to delegate to these stake pools.

This can be used in conjuction with the ISPO plugin that we have created that will provide rewards calculators for those that want to use a group of stake pools for multi rewards distribution, similar to how SundaeSwap ran their ISO in early 2021.

## Example Use Cases

There are many sites that have multiple stake pools listed on a site and allowing users to delegate their wallets from that list. Websites such as, [PoolPeek](https://poolpeek.com/), allow you to view these collection of stake pools and delegate your wallet. Our Stake Pools plugin allows you to create a similar site to PoolPeek without any coding knowledge (but of course it will help).


## Installation

Install & activate the plugin as you would any other WordPress plugin.

This plugin requires the parent plugin, [CardanoPress](https://github.com/CardanoPress/cardanopress/) and a Blockfrost API account to communicate to the Cardano blockchain.
